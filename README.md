# 🌟 JavaReflect — 3D Interactive Ray Tracing Engine in Java

![JavaReflect Banner](https://github.com/aryanbatras/Java-3D-Interactive-Engine-Ray-Tracing-/blob/main/Rendered%20Images/mirror.jpg)

> **JavaReflect** is a 3D interactive ray tracing engine built **entirely from scratch** in Java.  
> It features realistic rendering, user interaction, procedural scenes, object dragging, and multithreaded performance — all in a single powerful, extensible codebase.

---

## 🚀 Overview

JavaReflect simulates the physics of light using pure **ray tracing** principles in a self-built 3D environment. From photon-like rays bouncing off complex surfaces to drag-and-drop interaction and full camera control, this engine showcases the power of **modern Java** in graphical computing.

With **over 5,000 lines of handwritten code**, no third-party engines, and real-time interaction, this is more than a ray tracer — it’s a **learning tool**, a **sandbox**, and a **platform for 3D innovation**.

## 🎯 Features

### 🔷 Core Engine
- ✅ **Ray tracing** from scratch (primary, reflection, shadows planned)
- ✅ **Multithreaded** rendering loop (fast, scalable)
- ✅ **Antialiasing** with random sampling
- ✅ **Camera** with free movement, 360° mouse control, zoom, and orientation
- ✅ **Ground plane**, multiple visible objects, materials, and scene realism

### 🔷 Object System
- ✅ Spheres, Planes, Triangles, Boxes, Cones, Cylinders
- ✅ Unified object interface for movement, hit detection, scaling, center & radius manipulation
- ✅ Collision detection support between **any** shape combinations
- ✅ Mouse selection + dragging (intuitive user interaction)
- ✅ Fully OO design for extensibility

### 🔷 Scene & World
- ✅ Procedural scene generation with tunable randomness:
  - Sphere count, radius, position, fuzziness, materials, etc.
- ✅ Reflective ground support
- ✅ Reusable scene loaders
- ✅ Clean camera injection into render pipeline

### 🔷 Interface & Interaction
- ✅ **AWT-based Java window**
- ✅ Keyboard + Mouse control
- ✅ Realtime interaction and live rendering updates
- ✅ Scene redraw on interaction or camera shift
- ✅ Camera & object debug information printing
